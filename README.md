# Hydraxia: A Winterland's Fantasy
Hydraxia: A Winterland's Fantasy is a Minecraft 1.18 Terra 6.0 World Generation pack set in an eternal winter, with beautiful snowy terrain to explore and thrive.

**DISCLAIMER**
Hydraxia: A Winterland's Fantasy includes many configuration files are originally created by Astrash, Sancires, and dfsek, meant for the default 6.0 Terra generation pack. I have slightly edited such files, however the majority of the work in these specific files were created by the 3 I mentioned above. Huge thanks to the PolyDev team for creating such an amazing tool and stunning terrain for others to enjoy!

Check out the default 6.0 pack here:

Do note that this is the first version of the pack, so please report any bugs to the GitHub page linked to this pack. 

Once I've figured out how to use the darn platform, of course...

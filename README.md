# Hydraxia: A Winterland's Fantasy
Hydraxia: A Winterland's Fantasy is a Minecraft 1.18 Terra 6.0 World Generation pack set in an eternal winter, with beautiful snowy terrain to explore and thrive.

**DISCLAIMER**
Hydraxia: A Winterland's Fantasy includes many configuration files are originally created by Astrash, Sancires, and dfsek, meant for the default 6.0 Terra generation pack. I have slightly edited such files, however the majority of the work in these specific files were created by the 3 I mentioned above. Huge thanks to the PolyDev team for creating such an amazing tool and stunning terrain for others to enjoy!

Check out the default 6.0 pack here:

Do note that this is the first version of the pack, so please report any bugs to the GitHub page linked to this pack. 
Once I've figured out how to use the darn platform, of course...

# Biomes
Hydraxia: A Winterland's Fantasy consists of a few basic snow-themed biomes.



One of these biomes are the Snowswept Meadows, a typical vanilla Minecraft Plains biome with a few trees here and there, covered in a layer of snow, with rocks and boulders dotting the landscape.

Another common biome is called the Frostcoated Woodlands, your general forest with larger trees and bushes and of course, snow.

Boreal Peaks is a more extreme biome, extending up high in the air, giving you a breathtaking view of the world around you. Boreal Mountains surround it, and it has a bit more vegetation than its bigger counterpart.

Of course, an immersive world wouldn't be one without some sort of water source. Wintry Waters is a semi-frozen ocean that has Snowdrfit Coasts bordering it, spiky layers of rock that protrude from the depths of the water.
